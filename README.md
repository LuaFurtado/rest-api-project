# Book API

This project is part of the Techtonica curriculum and focuses on building a Book API using Node.js and Express.

The goal of the project is to create a RESTful API that serves book-related data and allows users to retrieve information through HTTP requests.

For this implementation, the API will serve Portuguese-language books that are in the public domain, including access to download links for available titles.

## Project Goals
- Build a REST API using Node.js and Express
- Practice RESTful routing and request handling
- Organize and serve book data through API endpoints
- Apply professional Git workflows using feature branches and pull requests

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- JavaScript

## Planned Endpoints
- `GET /books` – Retrieve a list of books
- `GET /books/:id` – Retrieve details for a specific book
- `GET /books/:id/download` – Access download link for a public domain book
